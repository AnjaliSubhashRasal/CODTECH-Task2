# Overview of the Project
## Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

## Objective 
   To develop a simple linear regression model to predict passenger fare (Fare) based on age (Age) using the Titanic dataset. The model's effectiveness will be evaluated through metrics like Mean Squared Error
   (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²), and visualized to assess its predictive accuracy and the relationship between the variables.

## To implement a simple linear regression model using the provided Titanic dataset, we will follow these steps:
## Data Preparation:
   Select a relevant continuous target variable (e.g., Fare) and a feature (e.g., Age). Handle any missing or invalid values.
   
## Split the Data:
   Divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

## Train the Model:
   Use the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn to train the model.

## Evaluate Performance:
   Calculate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   
## Make Predictions:
   Predict the target variable on the test set.

## Visualization:
   Plot the regression line against the data points.
